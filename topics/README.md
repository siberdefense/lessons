## CTFs

### InfoSec CTF Intro
- What is a Cyber Security Capture the Flag (CTF) event?

  - It's a collection of questions or challenges about cyber security topics.
    - Somtimes a challenge is as simple as answering a trivia question
    - More commonly they require applying your skills to solve a kind of problem
      that's frequently seen in the computer security field.
    - Often you must actually hack into a computer run by the event organizers.
  - An event starts when challenges are published, and players are seeing them
    for the first time.
  - By solving a challenge, you get access to a secret phrase.
  - To score points, you send the secret to a scoring server run by the event
      organizers to prove you solved it.

- Anyone can play in the online events.
  - Teams or individuals sign up to play, typically for free.
  - There are hundreds of public CTFs.
    - Some are oriented for beginners, typically at the high school level.
    - Others events are intended for experts.
    - Often they run for roughly a weekend
    - Some only last a few hours. Others run for weeks.

- How are we going to use CTFs?
  - For starters we're not going to jump straight in to a competition.
  - Thankfully a few event organizers keep their challenges online after their
    content is over.
  - We're going to work our way through those challenges from previous events.
  - That way we take away the time pressure and competitive part while we're
    more focused on learning the skills.
  - You're strongly encouraged to work together.
  - We'll use our Discord channel for asking questions.
  - Roughly once a month we'll get together to go over the challenge. I'll ask
    one of you to present your solution if you're comfortable.

- What makes them great for learning?
  - It's not about memorization. You have to think!
  - Then are often many ways to solve a challenge.

- So, what's it like to play?
  - Well this video is long enough.
  - In the next video I walk through a very
  easy challenge from PicoCTF.
